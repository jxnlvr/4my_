    <h2>What is Climate Change?</h2>
    <p>
      Climate change refers to long-term shifts in temperatures and weather patterns.
      These shifts may be natural, but since the 1800s, human activities—especially
      the burning of fossil fuels—have been the main driver of climate change.
    </p>
    <p>
The climate crisis is a major issue that needs urgent action from world leaders. As climate change speeds up, it's causing problems worldwide. These include rising sea levels and extreme weather events.

    <h2>Why Should We Care?</h2>
    <p>
      Climate change is not just an environmental problem, it is a crisis that affects every living being on Earth. Rising sea levels, extreme weather, and the loss of biodiversity threaten our homes, our health, and our future. Each day that we ignore it, the damage grows stronger and harder to reverse.
<br><br>
As Greta Thunberg said in her powerful speech at the United Nations Climate Action Summit, “How dare you pretend that this can be solved with just business as usual?” Her words remind us that our planet is like a house on fire, and we cannot simply look away. The choices we make today will decide the future of generations to come.
<br><br>
We should care because we still have the power to change the outcome. Small actions—like reducing waste, conserving energy, and supporting sustainable practices—can create a ripple of hope. Together, we can fight for a cleaner, safer, and more sustainable world.

<h2>Effects of Climate Change</h2>
<p><b>Global Temperature Rises and Their Impact</b><br><br>

Rising global temperatures have big effects on our environment and economy. We can expect more intense weather, like hurricanes and droughts, as temperatures go up.
<br><br>
<b>Environmental Consequences</b><br><br>

The environmental consequences of rising temperatures are wide-ranging. They include melting glaciers, rising sea levels, and losing biodiversity. These changes can harm ecosystems, leading to species extinction and habitat disruption.

<br><br><b>Social and Economic Effects</b><br><br>

Climate change also has big social and economic effects. It can cause communities to move, jobs to be lost, and food and water to become scarce. The worst hit are often low-income groups and indigenous peoples.

<h2>Purpose and Expectations</h2>
<p>Greta's rise to international recognition was quick. She spoke at the United Nations Climate Action Summit in 2019. Her passionate speech, "How Dare You," caught the world's attention. She made it clear: world leaders are not addressing the climate crisis.
</p>
<p>The summit's main goal was to speed up global action on climate change. Leaders were expected to share plans to cut down greenhouse gas emissions. They also aimed to switch to renewable energy.
